      <p><h4>I have enrolled in private cello lessons since 6th grade that helped pave the way for me to get promoted to first chair during Fall 2017 as well as achieve the distinction of receiving the Certificate of Merit, Level 4, Level 5 and Level 6 from the Music Teacher's Association of California (MTAC). Srinand to make a link to MTAC HERE.
          MTAC is a well-known, well-respected organization comprised mostly of professional musicians who must prove a degree in the instrument they teach.</h4></p>
      <p><h4> Certificate of Merit requires each student to play a given sheet of technique (scales and arpeggios and an extra element such as a chromatic scale or double stops) in addition to an etude, which will
        also show their technique from a list provided by MTAC. The student must play two pieces, one memorized, both from differing music periods and at two different tempi. A student should also sight-read a piece of music for the first time.
        In addition, the student must take a music theory test, according to their level, which demonstrates knowledge of key signatures, chords, major and minor scales, rhythms, time signatures, vocabulary from a given list and the ability to recognize and distinguish between different intervals
        and scales and articulation in the ear training portion of the test.</h4></p>
        <p><h4> A successful completion of the exam entails that the student memorize their piece and meet the standards of intonation, rhythm, consistency of sound in all areas and thorough knowledge of their pieces and technique.
        </h4></p>
