        I have played soccer for the past 10 years, most recently with Sunnyvale Alliance Soccer Club and West Valley Youth Soccer League. For the past six years,  I have participated in competitive leagues such as Norcal Premier and Competitve Youth Soccer Association, as well as many tournaments in
        the Bay Area. I usually play wing-back, and though the position is defensively-oriented, I like to push forward in attack as much as possible; in my time with West Valley, I scored 6 goals and provided 10 assists. My West Valley team won the 2013
        District Fall Cup and the 2014 Cal North Competitive Soccer League, and I personally won my team's defensive player of the season in 2014.

        I have also coached young kids by volunteering my time at the American Youth Soccer Association, where I helped younger players develop an interest in the game. My responsibilities as an assistant coach included working with the head coach to develop training schedules, conducting training for the
        team, and assisting the head coach in selecting the starting lineup on gamedays. In my second season as an assistant coach, my team went undefeated in the league and subsequently won the AYSO Invitational Tournament.
