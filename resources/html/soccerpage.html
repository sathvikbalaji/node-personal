        I have played soccer for the past 10 years with recent engagements as a member of Sunnyvale Alliance and West Valley teams that participate in competitive leagues in Santa Clara County. I have won multiple tournaments as a member of the West Valley team.
        I play the wing defense and midfield positions and was honored by my coach Mr. Dean Eyers as the "Wall" of the team for excellent defense maneuvers in actual games.

        I have also coached young kids by volunteering my time at the American Youth Soccer Association (AYSO), where I helped enrich young players by teaching and instructing them in the game of soccer. Additionally, I mentored and conducted tryouts for the junior players, worked with team's coach
        on training schedules and helped select team players for actual games. This helped me develop my leadership skills.
